## Panel Text
Throughout the operation of this event, law enforcement are in fact encountering armed individuals. The use of law enforcement air support is critical to keep not only law enforcement safe, but innocent and peaceful demonstrators. We need to ensure the movement of law enforcement trying to protect the innocent is not being broadcast live by the use of drones. With today’s technology this would be very easy to do with a drone and the camera capabilities.

## Transcript

The Standing Rock Sioux Nation, along with thousands of Native and non-Native supporters known as Water Protectors, literally stood in opposition to the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline. The proposed pipeline threatened Native sovereignty, water and land resources, and cultural and spiritual sites for the Sioux and other Native nations. For ten months during 2016 and 2017, Water Protectors faced harsh harassment from state police, the National Guard, and  privacy security firms, guard dogs, pepper spray. And of course, Water Protectors experienced heavy surveillance from local, state, and federal forces. Using similar drone technology to that the police used to monitor and track the activities of Water Protectors, indigenous activists documented the brutality and force, as well as the protest, from the sky. In their surveillance of being surveilled, the Drone Warriors have the ultimate forbidden technology. Their efforts directly addressed neocolonial military and corporate surveillance technology, and augmented their own protest efforts through that technology. When the Water Protectors cried out, “Mni wiconi”, or “water is life”, they are highlighting the domination and structural oppression that has existed for hundreds of years, taking the mistrusted technology and turning it into a tool of resistance.
