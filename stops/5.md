Delivering differentiated and satisfying customer experiences can lead to a boost in loyalty, market share and revenues. Imagine what a similar focus on employee experiences could mean for the business. **Leading companies are already recognizing that the employee experience is the new battleground for competitive advantage.** The next step is to apply what they know about customer experiences to build superior employee experiences that drive employee engagement, retention and productivity.

## Transcript

This corporate surveillance isn’t limited to consumers - it also affects employees as it monitors workers’ every move. Thanks to modern technology, employee monitoring follows workers’ activity and communication at every step of the process - from recruitment procedures through retirement. This, too, has a long history. Engineer Herman Hollerith patented the punch card in 1889 and Willard Le Grand Bundy patented the workman’s time recorder in 1890, two key technologies that eventually merged with other time equipment businesses to form IBM in 1913. And the patents continue to be issued today. In 2018, Amazon received two patents for wristbands to “streamline time consuming tasks” by emitting sound pulses and radio transmissions to track employee hands in relation to inventory bins. At your desk, Microsoft’s Workplace Analytics monitors employee data like time spent on email, meetings, or working after hours. But who wears and uses these devices? Who owns that recorded data? And how does that ownership affect the power dynamics of work-related surveillance?

Corporate collaborators suggest that policies and frameworks are being developed to ensure responsible and ethical use of the data. But consistent opposition and resistance to employee surveillance isn’t widespread. While physical surveillance, like a manager in the office was once easier to spot, employees have difficulty being able to even determine when they are being monitored. worker resistance today is often found in counter institutional websites, where employees collectively organize around their complaints in gripes.
