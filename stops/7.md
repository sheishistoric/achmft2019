## Transcript

We - the monitored and surveillance - talk about surveillance as a generalized concept. We are aware of its presence, and sometimes mock the ways in which it is presented to us. It is never as easy as just dodging or reversing surveillance, but rather to understand the ways in which it has affected us as individuals, communities, and as participants in a technological landscape. I hope this installation is one step in acknowledging that process. 

Thank you for your participation in this installation. If you have borrowed headphones from the museum, please return them to the large tables where you retrieved them. However, you should feel free to keep your guidebook as a souvenir, or to return to the website at any time.
