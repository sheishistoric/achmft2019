Welcome to the ACH Installation for the Museum of Forbidden Technologies - your presence has been noted. Please take a guidebook as you explore the five objects on display. You may notice that the objects are obscured from view, and explanatory plaques have been partially blacked out. When it comes to surveillance, the knowledge of its practice, usage, and existence is strictly prohibited.

This exhibit, as explained in the guidebook, is designed to bring awareness to the ways in which the digital surveillance is a constant in current-day United States. Computing technology exacerbates the surveillance experience, and assists it in infiltrating multiple domains of our lives - from work, to school, to home, to the world. What is forbidden is trying to circumvent it, problematize it, and acknowledge the ways it refracts our experience. Through this audio guide & guidebook, we highlight the ways surveillance and surveillance technologies have been defined, acknowledged, resisted, and occasionally addressed. Welcome to the Museum of Forbidden Technologies. We invite you to use the sticky notes to post your own experiences with these various domains of surveillance as you move throughout the room.

### Resources

Welcome to Night Vale is part of the Night Vale Presents network.
