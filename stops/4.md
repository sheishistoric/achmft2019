## Transcript

Late-stage capitalism thrives on the “surveillance capitalism” model. Coined by social psychologist Shoshana Zuboff, the term refers to the processes through which companies monitor, analyze, and influence users through digital tracking of purchases, web searches, and other personal data, converted into behavioral data. Users’ data is then used to predict and influence future markets. Surveillance becomes not about automating the information flow about the user, but automating the user. Like most forms of surveillance, users wouldn’t support these policies at face value. Rather, the actual methods and mechanisms for how surveillance capitalism works have been obscured from public view. This automated behavior bypasses our awareness, and we don’t know how it works. There aren’t easy ways to resist surveillance capitalism - but as Zuboff notes, “naming and taming” these tools is the first step to curbing it. As Zuboff noted, “demanding privacy from surveillance capitalists or lobbying for an end to commercial surveillance on the internet...it’s like asking a giraffe to shorten its neck or a cow to give up chewing. These demands are existential threats that violate the basic mechanisms of the entity’s survival.”

### Definition
**surveillance capitalism**: the unilateral claiming of private human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. (Zuboff 2018)
